# YEOM AI Lab

Purpose:
This repository is for exploring how Groq AI could be integrated into YEOM.

Scope:
- Set up a simple Groq AI working example
- Explore whether Groq aligns with YEOM’s product direction
- Build a small prototype or proof of concept
- Document findings, tradeoffs, and recommendations

Constraints:
- This is an experimental repo, not production code
- Freedom to choose tools/frameworks as needed
- Focus on clarity and learning, not polish

Timeline:
- Short-term contributor trial (2 weeks)
- Async, part-time

Deliverables:
- Working example (code)
- Clear documentation of what was done, what worked, what didn’t, and next steps
